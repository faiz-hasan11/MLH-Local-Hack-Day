            <p>Plastics are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Sorted by polymer type</li>
                <li>Shredded</li>
                <li>Washed</li>
                <li>Melted</li>
                <li>Pelletised</li>
                <li>Made into new products.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>It is a two-stage process:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Sorting is mainly done automatically with a manual sort to ensure all contaminants have been removed
                </li>
                <li>Once sorted and cleaned, plastic can either be shredded into flakes or melt processed to form pellets
                    before finally being moulded into new products.</li>
            </ul>

                Plastic is a popular and highly versitile material, and we use a lot of it. Optimising the lifespan of
                plastics by re-using and recycling items as many times as possible, for example, by recycling used plastic
                bottles into new ones, we can therefore reduce our need to create new plastic.
    
                This means we can:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>conserve non-renewable fossil fuels (oil)</li>
                <li>reduce the consumption of energy used in the production of new plastic</li>
                <li>reduce the amount of solid waste going to landfill</li>
                <li>reduce emission of gases like carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                There are many different types of plastic in use, some of which we can recycle in the UK and other types –
                including that used to make flexible pouches – which will require new technology before we are able to
                recycle it effectively. This means that some plastic still goes to landfill, some is incinerated and some
                shipped abroad for recycling.
    
                There are currently large investments being made in Britain to help our domestic plastic recycling sector
                cope with the variety of plastics in use and it won't be long before we operate a more efficient recycling
                system for all different types of plastic packaging.
    
                In the meantime we can all do our bit to improve things now. Recycling plastic bottles is one easy way to
                help. They are usually made from two easily recyclable plastics – PET and HDPE – and can be recycled by most
                of us via our household recycling collections or local recycling centres.

            <header>The different types of plastic</header>
    
            <p>You may notice symbols on plastic packaging explaining the type of plastic they're made of and how to recycle
                them. Read Packaging symbols explained for more information.
    
                You may have seen an increase in businesses moving to different types of plastic packaging, but knowing your
                bio-plastics from your biodegradable plastics can be very confusing.
    
                Plastic can be made from fossil-based or bio-based materials. Both can be used to make highly durable,
                non-biogradable plastics, or plastics which either biodegrade or compost.
    
                Fact: Just because a plastic is made from bio-based sources, does not automatically mean it will biodegrade!
    
                Only non-biodegradable plastic can be recycled, regardless of whether it is fossil-based or bio-based. Enter
                your postcode into our Recycling Locator tool to find out which plastics your council collects.
    
                Compostable plastics can be composted at industrial scale composting facilities, so you can put these in
                with your green waste but only if it goes to one of these facilities - your council will be able to tell you
                where your green waste goes.
    
                Some compostable plastics can also be home composted and should be clearly labelled if this is the case.
                Compostable plastics should not go in with your dry recycling as they cannot be recycled in the same way as
                non-biodegradable plastic.
    
                Biodegradable plastics also cannot be recycled in the same way as non-biodegradable plastics. Some can be
                composted, but not all, and should be clearly labelled if this is the case.
    
                Biodegradable packaging should be clearly labelled as such, and should not go in with your dry recycling.
